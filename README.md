# Synth Sandbox

To run this project, you'll need to install Node.js and npm: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After the npm package `http-server` has been installed with `npm install -g http-server`, run the program wih `http-server` from the command line.

## Current bugs

There seems to be a slight misalignment between the beginnings of notes and pitch changes.

After changing the value in the rhythm menu there's sometimes a delay before the scheduled event starts. You can see in the console messages though that the event is scheduled without a delay.
